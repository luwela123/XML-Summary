Introduction to XML
-------------------
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a simple, flexible way to structure and store data in a format that's both human-readable and machine-friendly. It uses custom tags to organize data in a hierarchical manner, making it easy to share across different systems and platforms. Unlike HTML, which focuses on displaying content, XML is all about data storage and transfer. It's widely used in web services, configuration files, and databases because of its versatility and ease of integration. Think of it as a universal language for data exchange, where you define the rules based on what you need.
